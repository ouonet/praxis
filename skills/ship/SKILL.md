# Ship

If `topology=multi-module` (triage announcement or coordinator spec/plan declaration), read `../references/multi-module.md`.

**Gates — if any fail, stop here:**

- Tests pass — or, for tasks with no automated test, their manual acceptance was performed.
- No `- [ ]` remains in any relevant plan.
- Staging spec reflects actual code behavior.
- No incomplete TodoWrite tasks.
- For multi-module work: module plans and local acceptance are complete, and coordinator integration passes (or the change is reported as `partial-commit`).

1. `review` the whole diff.

2. **Update `docs/ROADMAP.md`** (if it exists):
   - Milestone completed? Mark `[x]`.
   - Scope changed? Adjust upcoming milestone descriptions.
   - Unrelated work (bugfix, refactor)? Roadmap unchanged.

3. `archive` — for multi-module work, archive module artifacts in their owning repositories first; archive the coordinator last.

4. If user-visible, add to CHANGELOG `Unreleased`. Releases move it to a version.

5. Ask: **commit / merge / PR / keep / discard.** For an approved linked multi-repository implementation, commit is already in scope: commit non-coordinators in dependency order, write their commit IDs as the revision set, then commit the coordinator last. Use the shared change-set ID in every commit.

If a linked commit fails, report `partial-commit`, preserve all commits and working trees, and report the exact recovery point.

6. On merge or PR: clean up worktree, delete local branch.

7. Roadmap has unchecked milestones? → `plan` next.

No push or PR without explicit user approval.
