# Plan

`docs/staging/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`. Reference the spec; don't restate it.

If unresolved spec notes affect implementation or task order, return to `design`.

## Multi-module plan

If `topology=multi-module` (triage announcement or coordinator spec/plan declaration), read `../references/multi-module.md`. Open the workspace plan with the declaration block (`topology: multi-module`, `change-set`, `coordinator`, `repos`, module plan paths, integration task) - it is the on-disk mode marker downstream skills rely on.

- Write the workspace plan in the coordinator repository and a module plan in every affected module's owning repository.
- The workspace plan lists the change-set ID, coordinator, repositories, module plan paths, and the integration task.
- Every task names exactly one `repository:` and one `module:`. Cross-module verification is an `integration` task owned by the coordinator.
- Order contract tasks before consumers, local acceptance before integration, and integration before linked commits.
- Mark tasks parallel only when they have independent write scopes and acceptance.
- Adding a repository after implementation starts requires returning to `design`.

## Rolling wave

Spec references a milestone (`milestone: MN`)? Check `docs/ROADMAP.md` — expand only that milestone. Leave the rest as stubs.

After `ship`: open `docs/ROADMAP.md`, confirm which milestone is next, then expand it. Return to `design` only if the milestone's goal materially changed.

## Milestone tasks (30-60 min each)

Every task is `- [ ] T<n>: <name>` - always a checkbox, never a heading. `tdd`/`subagents` flip it to `- [x]` on completion; `ship` refuses to run while any `- [ ]` remains.

```
goal:       <one sentence>
files:      <paths>
acceptance: <test or cmd>
spec:       <docs/staging/specs/...#anchor>
```

No exact code. No step-by-step. Acceptance is verifiable: a test, command, or scripted check — or, when none is possible, an explicit manual check (steps + expected result). Each task leaves the repo green.

Mark independent tasks: `[parallel] T3, T4, T5`.

Only mark `[parallel]` when shared contracts, state, errors, and acceptance are closed.

**Atomic expansion is deferred until dispatch time** - `subagents` expands a milestone into 2-5 min steps at dispatch time, not here.

for **New project**: derive an initialization task — scaffold code, tests, CI, and always include: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, and a `Makefile` (or equivalent task runner config).

## Don't put in the plan

background, architecture, rationale (spec), CI commands, copy-pasted acceptance.

## Hand off

`<gate>` The plan must exist on disk before handing off to `tdd`/`subagents`. For multi-module work, this means the coordinator workspace plan and every affected module plan in its owning repository. `</gate>`

Confirm plan with the user.

mostly `[parallel]` → `subagents`. Otherwise → `tdd`.
