**Praxis** is a discipline framework for AI coding agents to build complex, multi-module, multi-repository projects through structured workflows—delivering **high quality**, **high efficiency**, and **extreme token savings**.

Tell your agent *what you need* and *what done looks like*—not *how to do it*. As AI gets smarter, declarations of intent, trigger-based spec review gates, 3D quality standards, and multi-module topology ensure robust, enterprise-grade execution without context bloat.

### Core Value Pillars

- 🎯 **Workflow-Driven**: Inline triage routes tasks to precise skill chains (`design` → `plan` → `tdd` → `review` → `ship`).
- 🛡️ **High Quality**: Parallel spec review gates and 3D quality standards (mechanical checks, convention adherence, design cohesion, doc-coverage) guarantee production readiness.
- ⚡ **High Efficiency & Token-Lean**: Skills average ~230 tokens each (~1,300 tokens per full feature cycle vs 30–50k in legacy frameworks). No ceremony for trivial edits.
- 📦 **Multi-Module & Multi-Repo**: Coordinate complex changes across multiple repositories seamlessly via designated coordinator specs and change-set manifests.

**📖 [Full documentation](https://ouonet.github.io/praxis/)**

> 💡 **Looking for the single-module version (v2.4.0)?** If you prefer the legacy single-module setup of Praxis without multi-module topology or spec review gates, checkout or install from the [`single-module`](https://github.com/ouonet/praxis/tree/single-module) branch.

## Quick Start

**Claude Code**
```bash
claude plugins marketplace add ouonet/praxis 
claude plugins install praxis@praxis
claude 'do a todo list app'
```

**pi CLI**
```bash
pi install git:github.com/ouonet/praxis
pi 'do a todo list app'
```

## How it works

At session start, a hook injects the `praxis:using-praxis` startup skill. It tells your agent:

1. Classify scope inline using the triage table embedded in `using-praxis` — no Skill call needed.
2. Load only the skills that scope needs. **Trivial tasks skip the waterfall entirely.**
3. Follow the loaded skill literally; don't freelance past `<gate>` markers.

Multi-module is a **topology**, declared alongside scope: when one change spans multiple modules or repositories, the agent adds `topology=multi-module` to the announcement and every loaded skill follows the multi-module protocol. See [Multi-module work](#multi-module-work) below.

## Skills

| Skill | Description | Tokens |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| [onboard](skills/onboard/SKILL.md) | existing project with no docs/tech-spec.md | ~450 |
| [design](skills/design/SKILL.md) | scope ≥ standard, anything new; handles vague goals & trigger-based spec reviewers | ~1,180 |
| [plan](skills/plan/SKILL.md) | after design approval; milestone tasks | ~740 |
| [tdd](skills/tdd/SKILL.md) | implementing or fixing; 3D quality refactor gate | ~590 |
| [debug](skills/debug/SKILL.md) | something broken; root cause isolation | ~160 |
| [review](skills/review/SKILL.md) | before merge / after subagent task; checks standards & doc-coverage | ~420 |
| [worktree](skills/worktree/SKILL.md) | non-trivial or parallel work in Git worktrees | ~320 |
| [subagents](skills/subagents/SKILL.md) | independent tasks, fan-out; includes ROLE charters and MODEL tiers | ~1,030 |
| [ship](skills/ship/SKILL.md) | merge / PR / cleanup | ~430 |
| [archive](skills/archive/SKILL.md) | merge spec into living docs, delete staging files | ~730 |
| [release](skills/release/SKILL.md) | version / tag / publish | ~230 |

Shared protocols & reference standards:
- [Quality Standard](skills/references/quality.md) (~430 tokens): mechanical checks, convention adherence, design assessment, and doc-coverage rules.
- [Spec Reviewers](skills/references/reviewers.md) (~1,640 tokens): trigger table and charters for parallel spec review subagents.
- [Multi-Module Protocol](skills/references/multi-module.md) (~870 tokens): topology specification for cross-repository/module changes.

## Token budget

Praxis minimizes prompt overhead by executing triage inline at session start and loading skills only when their scope is required:

| Task Scope | Loaded Skills | Approximate Token Budget |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Bootstrap (session start) | `using-praxis` (inline triage) | ~680 |
| Trivial task | None (bootstrap only) | ~680 |
| Small task | `tdd` | ~1,270 |
| Standard task | `design` + `plan` + `tdd` + `review` | ~3,600 |
| Complex task | `design` + `plan` + `worktree` + `subagents` + `review` + `ship` | ~4,800 |

## Model tiers

When dispatching subagents (`subagents` skill) or design reviewers (`design` review gate), Praxis uses three capability tiers instead of hardcoded model IDs:

| Tier | Use when | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| `fast` | Mechanical edits, simple checks | rename a constant, pattern-match review |
| `balanced` | Standard implementation, single-file work | add a function, write routine tests |
| `strongest` | Complex reasoning, safety review | implement a protocol, review crash-recovery |

Resolution: `.praxis/model-tiers.yaml` in project root or user home maps each tier to a concrete model ID. No config file → all subagents use the harness default. Template: [`model-tiers.example.yaml`](model-tiers.example.yaml).

## Multi-module work

> **Availability:** Multi-module topology is fully supported in Praxis v4.0+.

When one change spans multiple modules or repositories, Praxis runs in **multi-module topology**. The agent declares it at triage and carries it on every turn:

```
praxis: scope=complex, topology=multi-module, loading=design,plan,worktree,subagents,review,ship
```

(`topology=multi-module` is omitted on ordinary single-module turns.)

**Coordinator.** You designate one *existing* repository as the coordinator - the agent won't infer this. It owns the cross-module spec/plan and the change manifest.

**Mode marker.** The coordinator spec (created at `design`) and workspace plan (created at `plan`) each open with a declaration block. This on-disk declaration is what keeps the agent in multi-module mode across a long change - it reads the declaration to re-establish mode instead of relying on session memory:

```
topology: multi-module
change-set: <topic-id>
coordinator: <repo path>
repos: <repo paths>
```

The workspace plan adds module plan paths and the integration task. Each module also gets its own spec and plan in its owning repository, referencing shared contracts defined once in the coordinator - never duplicated.

**Lifecycle.** `design` (coordinator + per-module specs) → `plan` (workspace + per-module plans) → `tdd`/`subagents` per module → integrate against the coordinator's acceptance → commit in dependency order, coordinator last, recording each SHA as the revision set.

**Safety.** Each repo is inspected before editing - a missing repo, red baseline, or unrelated dirty change blocks the change. Praxis never auto-clones, resets, rebases, or discards. Put the change-set ID in branch names and commit subjects, e.g. `[praxis:checkout-v2]`. Cross-repo commits aren't atomic; the recorded revision set is the reproducibility boundary.

Full protocol: [`skills/references/multi-module.md`](skills/references/multi-module.md) (experimental).

## Documentation Structure

Praxis enforces a strict documentation structure and keeps code and docs in sync at every step.

### Living Documentation

**Living documentation** — describes the current system state and direction. Always in sync with code.

- **`README.md`** — for users: what it is, who for, how to use it
- **`docs/tech-spec.md`** — for developers/agents: current system state ([format](skills/archive/SKILL.md#tech-spec-format))
- **`docs/specs/*.md`** — details split out of the tech-spec when it grows too bulky; referenced by path
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — direction and milestones (exists when project has ≥3 milestones or long-term direction)

`docs/tech-spec.md` uses a structured declaration format:

```
purpose / user / use-case / architecture / stack / entry /
contract / flow / invariant / constraint / convention / milestone
```

Facts only — no interpretation, no plans. If details are bulky — e.g. a complex flow (branching, async, multi-actor) that needs a diagram — split into `docs/specs/` and link; the spec keeps a one-line summary.

**Project artifacts** — records and conventions. Append-only or static.

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — version history, maintained by `ship`
- **`docs/decisions/`** — architectural decision log, append-only

### Staging Area

During active work, Praxis uses:

- **`docs/staging/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`** — Working spec for the current change.
- **`docs/staging/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`** — Executable milestone tasks.

At `ship`, the staging spec merges into living docs; staging files are deleted (Git keeps history).

### Code-Docs Sync

Praxis enforces synchronization at multiple checkpoints:

- **During [`tdd`](skills/tdd/SKILL.md)**: After each RED-GREEN-refactor cycle, sync docs before commit.
  - If staging spec exists → update it to match reality.
  - If no staging spec (small tasks) → update living docs directly.
- **At [`ship`](skills/ship/SKILL.md) gate**: Staging spec must reflect actual code behavior.
- **At [`review`](skills/review/SKILL.md)**: Check that README/comments reflect actual behavior.

**Quality and doc-coverage** are verified: `tdd` runs lint/format/typecheck + checks against `convention`; `review`/`ship` verify `contract` covers the full surface, env/errors documented, README commands runnable. See [`skills/references/quality.md`](skills/references/quality.md).

**The rule**: Code changes without doc updates fail review. Docs that don't match code block merge.

## Install

### Install from a branch

To pin or test a specific git branch or tag, append `#<branch>` (or `--ref <branch>`) to the install source URL as supported by your agent harness.

> **Single-module (v2.4.0 legacy):** Append `#single-module` or `@single-module` to install from the legacy single-module branch (e.g. `pi install git:github.com/ouonet/praxis@single-module`).

---

### Claude Code

```
claude plugins marketplace add ouonet/praxis
claude plugins install praxis
```

To update after new releases:

```
claude plugins update praxis
```

> Claude Code does not auto-update plugins. Run the update command manually after repo changes.

### Codex (CLI / app)

Praxis is distributed as a Codex marketplace. Register the marketplace from the CLI:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ouonet/praxis
```

Then open the plugin directory and install it from the Codex UI:

```
/plugins
```

Search for `praxis` and select **Install Plugin**.

If the marketplace was already added before an update, refresh it first:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade praxis-marketplace
```

### OpenCode

See [`.opencode/INSTALL.md`](.opencode/INSTALL.md).

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```
copilot plugin install ouonet/praxis
```

(Or symlink `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` per Copilot's plugin convention.)

### VsCode Copilot

```
open customization of copilot -> Plugins -> Install Plugin From Source -> input  "ouonet/praxis"
```

### Antigravity CLI

```
agy plugin install https://github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

Antigravity imports Praxis through the Gemini-compatible plugin path, including the session-start hook.

### Gemini CLI

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

The extension loads `skills/using-praxis/SKILL.md` as session context, so triage runs from the first turn.

### pi CLI

```bash
pi install git:github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

Praxis is distributed as a native pi package — pi auto-discovers skills from the `package.json` manifest. The `using-praxis` bootstrap is injected at session start automatically.

> **Specific branch/tag:** append `@<branch>` to install from a specific branch or tag (e.g. `pi install git:github.com/ouonet/praxis@single-module`).

**Install to project scope** (`.pi/settings.json`, shared with team):

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

**Update**:

```bash
pi update git:github.com/ouonet/praxis      # update one package
pi update --extensions                       # update all packages
pi update --all                              # update pi + packages
```

**Uninstall**:

```bash
pi remove git:github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

### Qoder CLI CN

Qoder CLI CN auto-discovers skills from the project's `skills/` directory — no hooks or manual loading needed.

Clone this repo and symlink (or copy) the `skills/` directory into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ouonet/praxis.git ~/.qoder-cn/praxis
ln -s ~/.qoder-cn/praxis/skills ./skills
```

Or install as an SDK plugin by pointing to the `.qoder-plugin/` manifest in your project config.

The `using-praxis` skill is auto-discovered and triggered at session start by its description.

### Manual / fallback

For harnesses without plugin support, add an instruction that reads `skills/using-praxis/SKILL.md` first.


## Verify it's working

Start a fresh session. Send: `let's build a react todo list`.

Expected: outputs `praxis: scope=standard, loading=design,plan,tdd,review` (no `Skill(praxis:triage)` call — triage is inline) and starts asking clarifying questions before touching code.

Send: `fix the typo "teh" in README`.

Expected: agent outputs `praxis: scope=trivial, loading=` and just fixes it. **No design doc, no plan, no TDD ceremony.**

## Examples

### Vague goal

```
You: I want to build something that helps developers manage their workflow
Agent: triage → vague → design
```

Design asks one clarifying question per turn until the problem is concrete enough to spec. If exploration produces a knowledge artifact (protocol spec, RE findings), it goes to `docs/decisions/` via `archive`.

### Tiny fix

```
You: fix the typo "teh" in README
Agent: triage → trivial → edit → done
```

### Standard feature

```
You: add OAuth login with GitHub
Agent: triage → design → plan → tdd → review → ship
```

Design investigates facts and asks only the current decision frontier in dependency order; plan writes milestone tasks; ship updates living specs and CHANGELOG `Unreleased`.

### Parallel work

```
You: migrate the entire API from REST to tRPC
Agent: triage → design → plan → worktree → subagents → review → ship
```

Subagents expand milestones at dispatch time; the coordinator reviews and marks tasks complete.

### Multi-module change

```
You: add a shared checkout flow across the api and web repos
Agent: triage → topology=multi-module → design (asks you to designate coordinator) → plan → tdd/subagents per module → integrate → ship
```

You designate one existing repo as coordinator; it holds the shared contract and integration check. Each module keeps its own spec/plan in its owning repo. At ship, non-coordinator repos commit in dependency order and the coordinator commits last, all sharing the change-set ID; their SHAs form the revision set.

### Onboard existing project

```
You: take over this project / add Praxis to this codebase
Agent: triage → onboard
```

Onboard explores the codebase and produces `docs/tech-spec.md` — a factual record of stack, contracts, conventions, and invariants. No code changes, no plans. After confirmation, the normal `design → plan → tdd` flow resumes.

### Release

```
You: release 1.2.0
Agent: triage → release
```

Release confirms the version, moves CHANGELOG `Unreleased`, then asks before commit, tag, push, or publish.

## Common Signals

| You ask                | Praxis does                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| I want to build X (vague) | vague → design (clarifies first) |
| fix typo               | trivial                            |
| add small field        | small → tdd                       |
| add feature            | standard → design/plan/tdd/review |
| migrate module         | complex → worktree/subagents      |
| change spans repos/modules | topology=multi-module (coordinator) |
| failing behavior       | debug                              |
| take over this project | onboard                            |
| release 1.2.0          | release                            |

## Philosophy

- **Intent, not instruction.** Tell the agent what to achieve and what done looks like. Let it decide how to do it.
- **Pay for discipline only when it pays back.** Triage decides.
- **Skills are short.** If a rule needs 3,000 tokens to express, it's probably not a rule, it's a manual.
- **Cross-harness via env detection,** not per-harness skill copies.
- **No ceremony around the rules** — state each rule once, clearly.
